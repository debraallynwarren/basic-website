  <h1>Bernie</h1>
  <h2>Our Gentle Giant</h2>
    
<p>Bernie, a stray who "timed-out" at a kill shelter, was first saved by the Longmont Humane Society. We adopted him from them after he had been there for about a month.</p>
					
<p>The shelter wasn't sure what kind of dog he was, and we think he was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catahoula_Cur" target="_blank">Catahoula Leopard</a> mix. He was a 75 pound gentle soul who's feelings hurt easily and he took as much affection as he could get.</p>

<p>Bernie was a master on a leash and a perfect walking companion if the walk was slow. If we stopped, he stopped and if we stopped for too long he sat down.</p>
  
<p>Bernie loved to sleep, but his favorite thing to do was to eat french fries. </p>
